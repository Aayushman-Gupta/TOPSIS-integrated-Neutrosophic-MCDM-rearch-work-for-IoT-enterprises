## 📚 Abstract

This project presents a hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) model integrating **Neutrosophic Set Theory** with **TOPSIS** for more robust decision-making in **IoT-based enterprise environments**. It handles uncertainty, vagueness, and conflicting evaluations more effectively than traditional methods.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ Handles uncertainty via **Neutrosophic Sets**
- ⚖️ Uses **TOPSIS** for distance-based alternative ranking
- 📶 Evaluates key IoT criteria: Security, Value, Intelligence, Transparency, Connectivity
- 📊 Real-world case study included

## 📌 Methodology Overview

### 🔷 Framework Overview

1. **Problem Structuring**
2. **Criteria Weighting (Trapezoidal Neutrosophic)**
3. **Decision Matrix Construction**
4. **TOPSIS-Based Ranking**
